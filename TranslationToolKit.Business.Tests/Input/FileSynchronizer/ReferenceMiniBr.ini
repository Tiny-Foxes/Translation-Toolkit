# READ THIS BEFORE CREATING OR EDITING STRINGS FOR THIS FILE
# Version: 4.9.6 alpha
# We kept many strings in english, like (for example) courses and steps.
# We did that for 2 reasons: community feedback and achieve improved context.
# The game simply doesn't look good with literal translations on everything.
# If you want to help, take a look at the translated strings to know how...
# ...to translate, what to and why;
# Also, check the GitHub repository: github.com/Tiny-Foxes/OutfoxPTBR

# Credits: people that helped with feedback during the first making of this file.

# Moru Zerinho6 - Lead Translator
# SHRMP0 - Spelling correction and word choice.
# SheepyChris - Spelling correction and word choice.
# Kawafumi - Translation content help.

# Thank them for working on a clever and better looking translation for everyone, and thank you for reading. ~ Moru Zerinho6
